# CampusRecruit-API
 Campus Recruit API streamlines the recruitment process by managing students, job postings, applications, interviews, users, and reports. Built with Spring Boot, Hibernate, and MySQL, it follows a layered architecture (Controller, Service, DAO). Features include CRUD operations, role-based access, and detailed reporting, tested using Postman.
